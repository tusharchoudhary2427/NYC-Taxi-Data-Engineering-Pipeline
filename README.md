# NYC-Taxi-Data-Engineering-Pipeline

This repository contains an end-to-end data engineering project built using the NYC Taxi trip dataset. The project focuses on pipeline design, ingestion strategy, transformation logic, and analytics-ready data modeling using a cloud-based architecture.

Each major component of the pipeline is documented within its respective folder.

This root README provides a high-level overview and guides readers to detailed documentation.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to design a scalable and maintainable data pipeline that converts raw public taxi trip data into structured, analytics-ready datasets.

The implementation follows a Medallion Architecture approach and emphasizes clear separation of concerns, production-style documentation, and constraint-driven decisions.

This project is designed to be executed primarily on a managed Spark environment. Python dependencies required for notebook execution are listed in `requirements.txt`.

Sensitive configuration details and credentials are intentionally excluded from version control.
